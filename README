# RUNNING APSYNSIM: #
#####################

If you work on Windows, run the binary file called APSYNSIM.exe, 
which is located in the APSYNSIM directory.

If you work on Mac, try to run the script (located in either the SCRIPT
or the SOURCE directory) with the command:

pythonw APSYNSIM.py

(notice the "w" at the end of the "python").

If the GUI does not respond well, then run the binary "APSYNSIM.app" 
(located in the APSYNSIM directory) *from*the*command*line*.

If you work on Linux, open a terminal, go to the the directory 
called SCRIPT (or SOURCE), and run the command "python APSYNSIM.py".

# USAGE: #
##########

You will find some examples of interferometer arrays and source models 
in the ARRAYS and SOURCE_MODELS directories, respectively, together with 
instructions on how you can build your own interferometers and source 
models (read, for instance, the content of the "default.array" and 
"default.model" files).

You can click and drag the antennas in the plot called "ARRAY CONFIGURATION".
When you drag an antenna, all other plots (UV PLANE, DIRTY BEAM, and DIRTY 
IMAGE) will be updated automatically (may need some time to refresh, 
especially if working on Windows and/or with many antennas).

You can also click on any point of the DIRTY BEAM, MODEL IMAGE, or DIRTY 
IMAGE plots, and the program will tell you the intensity value and the pixel 
coordinates.

If you click on the UV PLANE image, the program will print the value of the 
source Fourier transform at that point. If you click close to a point observed
with the interferometer, the program will tell you the baseline and hour
angle of observation.

You can also change the observing latitude, hour-angle coverage, source 
declination, and observing wavelength by clicking on the blue sliders at 
the bottom-right corner of the figure. The plots will be updated 
automatically (may also need some time to refresh all plots).

The dirty beam is computed using Briggs weighting. The robustness parameter
can be changed by shifting the corresponding blue slider (robustness of -2 
tends to uniform weighting, whereas +2 tends to natural weighting).

You can add and/or subtract antennas by pressing the "+ Antenna" and 
"- Antenna" buttons. New antennas are inserted at the array origin (0,0). 
If you add, drag, and subtract an antenna, the program will remember the 
last antenna positions if you add them again.

You can save the current array, load a new array (for instance, from the 
EXAMPLES folder), and/or load a new source model (for instance, from 
the EXAMPLES folder) by pressing the corresponding buttons "Save array", 
"Load array" and "Load model".

You can zoom in/out by pressing "Z" or "z" (respectively). The program will
then zoom using the current cursor position as zooming center.
 
The new "Reduce data" button opens a CLEAN GUI, where you can also corrupt
your visibilities, to see the effect on the DIRTY and CLEAN images.

Enjoy!
